Known Issues:

+ Error on close - due to grid cell editor
+ Error message dialog boxes do not force stop the code

+ Process based simulation should have ciw.no_routing for nodes which are not also arrival nodes.
  - this should not effect the simulation as the routes are formed based on the individual id_number of customer class.
+ Language error: Centroids should be Medoids
+ Names of distance matrix excel sheets too long
+ Capacity calculation should consider number of patients not number of tests
+ Capacity error if no solution
+ Capacity disable setup capacity button after first click
+ Capacity plot axis number of working days
+ Capacity plot over plot max
+ Capacity get target days from raw wait days
+ Capacity setup comment incorrect
+ Simulation Trials naming doesn't add to list of simulation names
+ Summary sheet heatmap should be for data not df
+ Simulation name process can be P_ insted of ce_
+ Main tables aren't saved
+ Naming of classic centroids excel sheet should be df
