Known Issues:

+ Error on close - due to grid cell editor
+ Error message dialog boxes do not force stop the code

+ Process based simulation should have ciw.no_routing for nodes which are not also arrival nodes.
  - this should not effect the simulation as the routes are formed based on the individual id_number of customer class.

Addressed Issues:

+ Language error: Centroids should be Medoids - Process Centroids changed to Process Medoids
+ Simulation name process can be P_ insted of ce_
+ Summary sheet heatmap should be for data not df
+ Naming of classic centroids excel sheet should be df - remove last _ from save_name - help file updated
+ Names of distance matrix excel sheets too long - codes used instead - help file updated
+ Clustering Distance Metric LCS - lcsstr changed to lcsseq 
+ Simulation Trials naming doesn't add to list of simulation names - Auto change name in sim_name box after trial complete

Version: 2.1
+ Capacity get target days from raw wait days - updated capacity input table
+ Capacity setup comment incorrect - updated capacity input table - corrected comment
+ Capacity plot over plot max - updated capacity input table and PlotWaitDays
+ Capacity plot axis number of working days - updated capacity input table 
+ Capacity disable setup capacity button after first click - Implemented to avoid cell editor error
+ Capacity calculation should consider number of patients not number of tests - Updated run_capacity
+ Capacity error if no solution - Appears to be solved in target_capacity
+ Capacity error if No on first fun - Solved through initial CalculatedCapacity in App
